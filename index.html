      <h2>Be a HellFire Club suppoter and partner</h2>
      <p>Hellfire Club is an American heavy metal band. The band was formed in 1986 in Hawkings by
      vocalist/guitarist Eddie Munson and drummer Dustin. The band's fast tempos, instrumentals and aggressive musicianship
      made them one of the most viewed youtube videos in 2022.<br>
      We're about to release our 1st album of brand new material and we are asking for your help as we plan
      for this release! <br>
      We have big plans for promotion and touring, but we have some significant expenses
      (videos, marketing and a downpayment on a van to tour in). More than funding our band, you will <b>become our partner!</b>
      for every donation over 50Usd you will <b>receive a Hellfire token</b> that allows you to claim our music in high definition and
      as soon we sign our first contract we will deposit 10% of contract value on our tokens. </p>
